# Setup

In this section we are going to cover the basics of setting up your characters and your game to provide you an optimal path for making gold.

## Characters

The good news is that you can use any character in your gold making journey.  However, many people prefer to use druids as their primary farming character because a druid with a [speed set](./speedsets) will be the fastest character in your arsenal and allow you to farm items quickly.

If you are doing transmog or non-current content many dungeon farms contain locked chests, so having the ability to open chests on your farming character is beneficial.  

### Bank Toon
No matter what character you choose to do farming, it is beneficial to have a "bank" character. This character is usually parked at a faction hub and rarely (if ever) moves away from the hub.  The character can be a level 1 character, but should always be equipped with the largest size bags to ensure they can hold a great deal of inventory.  This character will be where you post many or all of your auction house items.  Any of your other characters that are farming can send all of their spoils to this toon and this toon can focus on managing the auction house. It creates a nice separation of farming duties and auction house management.

### Character Classes

#### Druid
A <WowHeadClass id="11">Druid</WowHeadClass> is a great choice for your primary gold farming character. Feral is popular when you are running dungeons that require speed, while Balance is popular when doing 5-man content where the druid doesn't need to move much.

For a druid that is farming [Dungeons](/category/dungeons) the <WowHeadSpell id="193753">Dreamwalk</WowHeadSpell> spell is very useful for leaving a dungeon and then casting <WowHeadSpell id="193753">Dreamwalk</WowHeadSpell> again to return to the entrance to the dungeon.  

#### Rogue
A <WowHeadClass id="4">Rogue</WowHeadClass> can be a good choice for certain farms.  Even if your rogue isn't your primary farming toon, it is nice to have a leveled up rogue to whom you can funnel all of the lock boxes you might obtain from other farming toons.  

### Character Professions
If your gold making strategy focuses on selling the most recent content items, then you may need to evaluate which professions are doing well in the current content and make a decision about professions based on the most up to date information. As you become a more and more established goblin, you will probably end up having characters that cover most professions.

If you are farming old content then ideally your farming character has one profession that can open chests (Blacksmith, Jewelcrafter, or Inscription). If you are using a Rogue, then obviously you don't need a profession to do that for you.  

#### Mining

Depending on the content you are running, <WowHeadSkill id="186">mining</WowHeadSkill> can be useful.  For example, if you are running certain Burning Crusade dungeons, then you may encounter <WowHeadItem id="23426">Khorium</WowHeadItem>, which still sells for a decent amount of gold.

#### Engineering

Engineering is a popular choice for your farming characters due to the utility it provides.  The <WowHeadItem id="60854">Loot-A-Rang</WowHeadItem> is a great example of utility that helps when running farms where there are a lot of mobs to loot.
