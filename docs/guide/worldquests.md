# World Quests
World quests in World of Warcraft are a decent way to make gold once an expansion has been established for a while. The basic approach to make gold with World Quests is to establish an alt army with average gear.  

Your goal is to find a number of world quests that are easy to do and provide a decent sum of gold. Usually only the current expansion world quests drop enough gold to be considered worth completing for gold farming.  Once you have unlocked world quests on your main character, you can actually dual use world quests to help your alt army level up while you are also farming some gold.  Some quests directly just give you gold, while others, like the dragon riding quests, will give you a dragon riding purse that contains items and gold.

## Addons
To start it is recommended, but not required, to use a world quest addon like [World Quests List](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/world-quests-list) to consolidate the list of world quests on your map. These make it very easy to scan the lists of world quests for a zone or all zones in an expansion and find the ones that will provide you the best options to obtain gold.
