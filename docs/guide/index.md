## Gold Making Strategies
There are a few different gold making strategies that people use to create their wealth. We'll cover a few of them in this section and talk about the pros and cons of each.

### Raw Gold
Raw gold farms usually fall into a couple of categories, gold and vendorable items and world quests.

#### Gold and Vendorable Items
The first strategy is to farm mobs for true raw gold and vendorable items.  Usually any farm that generates a decent amount of gold via this method is nerfed very quickly by Blizzard and usually isn't worth the time to try and leverage.

#### World Quests
World quests can be a viable strategy for establishing your gold pile. If you have an alt army with multiple characters at max level, there often very easy world quests that can be done to generate hundreds to thousands of gold per character per day.  A thousand gold per day across an army of 10 characters could easily get you close to purchasing a wow [token](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-token) in any given month.
