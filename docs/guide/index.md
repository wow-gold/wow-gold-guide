# WoW Gold Guide
Welcome to the WoW gold guide a gold making guide for World of Warcraft.  In this guide we will cover the basics of gold making in World of Warcraft and how you can go from 0 to becoming a WoW millionaire. We'll start here with some of the high level strategies for making gold. We will then move on to setting you up for success by getting your characters setup in an optimal manner and getting some optional addons that will make your life much easier.  Everyone has a different approach to making gold and as long as you are profitable, do what works for you. Finally, we will get into specifics of various farms you can do to start making your gold.

## Gold Making Strategies
There are a few different gold making strategies that people use to create their wealth. We'll cover a few of them in this section and talk about the pros and cons of each.

### Raw Gold
Raw gold farms usually fall into a couple of categories, gold and vendorable items and world quests.

#### Gold and Vendorable Items
The first strategy is to farm mobs for true raw gold and vendorable items.  Usually any farm that generates a decent amount of gold via this method is nerfed very quickly by Blizzard and usually isn't worth the time to try and leverage.  While there may be some times where this is a viable method, it's not a sustainable long term strategy.

#### World Quests
World quests can be a viable strategy for establishing your gold pile. If you have an alt army with multiple characters at max level, there often very easy world quests that can be done to generate hundreds to thousands of gold per character per day.  A thousand gold per day across an army of 10 characters could easily get you close to purchasing a wow [token](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-token) in any given month.  See the [World Quests](./guide/worldquests) page for more information.

### Current Content Professions
Current content professions ebb and flow with the patch cycles.  At the beginning of a new expansion or a major patch in an expansion there are often new crafting recipes and materials which are in high demand and can often net large profits, especially if you are working in very high quantities.  

### Auction House Flipping
Auction house flipping can be a great way to build up a nest egg or use your gold pile to dominate a market.  Just remember this is almost always a bigger whale out there ready to pounce if you make a mistake and overreach.  

### Farming Old Content (Transmog)
When farming old content, you are often looking for rare items that can be used for transmogrification or for plans and patterns that are desirable to completionists. For simplicity sake, I am going to refer to these types of farms as transmog throughout the guide.
