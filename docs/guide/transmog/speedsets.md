# Speed Sets
The primary goal for a speed set is to increase your movement speed as a farmer, so you can more quickly gather and kill enemies.  In this speed set, you will use armor that is significantly lower than top item level, so you will need to swap out your speed set if you are trying to do current content.

## The Theory
To create a speed set in World of Warcraft, you want to obtain items that either explicitly grant you speed and/or increase one of your stats that is linked to your speed.  Speed is considered a [tertiary stat](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/attributes-and-stats-from-world-of-warcraft-6117#tertiary-stats) in WoW and is a random addition to BOE and BOP items.  For many of the items in this set, you will need to scour the auction house to find items with a +Speed stat.  Luckily, tools like the Undermine Exchange contain [searches](https://undermine.exchange/#us-area-52/search/cat=4.2...61) to find speed items on the Auction House.  Many people have caught on that speed items are desirable and are often priced accordingly.  

### Azerite Items
For this speed set, we will be using the Battle for Azeroth item the <WowHeadItem id="158075" showGold="false">Heart of Azeroth</WowHeadItem> which allows Head, Chest, and Shoulder armor to provide you with additional Azerite powers.  The Azerite Power <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> increases your movement speed based on your highest secondary stat. The specifics in this guide will cover specific items for a druid speed set, but you can swap the Azerite items based on your classes using the [Wowhead Azerite Finder](https://www.wowhead.com/azerite-finder).  

For the Azerite items, you want to find the items with <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> that drop from the normal versions of the major dungeons in the Battle for Azeroth expansion. These items have the best item level and the <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> attribute seems to perform best from these items.

### Gems
When obtaining items for the speed set, the more gem slots you can get the better.  You want to max out your secondary stat to maximize the effect of the <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> Azerite power, so most of your gems (with a caveat below) should be in an effort to maximize your secondary stat. When searching for speed items on the auction house, ideally you will find some with your chosen secondary stat and additional socket spaces.  The <WowHeadItem id="213777">Magnificent Jeweler's Setting</WowHeadItem> can add a second slot to both of your rings, so make sure to use that to add those sockets.

There is also the <WowHeadItem id="213744">Elusive Blasphemite</WowHeadItem> gem that grants 2% movement speed per unique Algari gem color you have in your set.  Since this is a flat speed increase, it is more important than your secondary stat gems and getting one of each Algari gem color should be prioritized as you are building out your set.

### Consumables
<WowHeadItem id="172063">Fried Bonefish</WowHeadItem> is a food that grants you a small speed bonus every time you kill an enemy. Since you are building out a farming character, you will most likely be doing a lot of killing and triggering this effect often.

The <WowHeadItem id="191350">Charged Phial of Alacrity</WowHeadItem> is a flask that grants an increase to your speed attribute and is a great choice.  There are also the [Flask of Tempered ...](https://www.wowhead.com/search?q=flask%20of%20tempered) flasks that can increase your secondary stat that you are maxing out to increase the <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> effect.  For example, a druid might consider the <WowHeadItem id="212271">Flask of Tempered Aggression</WowHeadItem> to increase their critical strike by 2825. However, the Flasks of Tempered ... are significantly more expensive than the <WowHeadItem id="191350">Charged Phial of Alacrity</WowHeadItem> and the benefit may not be worth the increased cost to you.

## The Set
The specifics I am including in this set are for a druid. If you are using a monk, rogue, or any other character, use the [Wowhead Azerite Finder](https://www.wowhead.com/azerite-finder) to find the appropriate <WowHeadSpell id="268594">Longstrider</WowHeadSpell> items and choose your secondary stat and replace that stat for the critical strike I included in the items here.

For Druid's you can start by searching for items with specific suffixes.  The `of the Peerless`, `of the Fireflash` and `of the Quickblade` items all have critical strike on them.

This list is written with the ideal setup. If you find a cloak with a socket and speed, but it is missing your secondary stat, it is a fine placeholder until you can find the perfect cloak for you.  There is a lot of min/maxing that can be done on speed sets and perfection should never get in the way of good enough.

### Feet
Boots are a special item in this speed set. You want to enchant them with <WowHeadItem id="38837">Enchant Boots - Minor Speed</WowHeadItem> which can only be applied to items at Item Level 320 and below.  That enchant gives a raw 10% speed increase, so it will be better to use lower level boots with that enchant than trying to find higher level speed and critical strike boots.  

The easiest boots to obtain will be the <WowHeadItem id="172251">Shadebound Treads</WowHeadItem>, which are a crafted item where you can use the <WowHeadItem id="173161">Missive of Critical Strike</WowHeadItem> to add critical strike to the item and <WowHeadItem id="187831">Pure-Air Sail Extensions</WowHeadItem> to add speed to the boots.

### Trinkets
For trinkets, you are looking for anything that helps with your secondary stat or speed. The Darkmoon Deck has a few decent trinkets:
- <WowHeadItem id="222671">Darkmoon Deck: Vivacity</WowHeadItem>
- <WowHeadItem id="222680">Darkmoon Deck: Ascension</WowHeadItem>

There are also other questing or vendor trinkets that can do pretty well:
- <WowHeadItem id="217894">Nerubian Pheromone Secreter</WowHeadItem> with the <WowHeadItem id="227448">Volatile Fragrance</WowHeadItem> to add critical strike
- [Wildfire Wick](https://www.wowhead.com/item=218307/wildfire-wick?bonus=11337)

Your best bet is to probably use <WowHeadItem id="222671">Darkmoon Deck: Vivacity</WowHeadItem> along with the <WowHeadItem id="217894">Nerubian Pheromone Secreter</WowHeadItem> as a decent starting point and you can tweak if you find something better.
