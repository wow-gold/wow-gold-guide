# Terminology
This page lists some common terminology that is used in the gold making community.  If you are watching a content creator and they use a term you aren't familiar with, it will probably be here.

## 2x4
Also known as a 2 by 4 farm where two groups of four people work together on a farm. This works because up to 5 people can tag a mob to obtain loot from it. For anyone who tags a mob, their entire group is granted loot from that mob.

## 5-Man
A 5-man group usually refers to a farm that is best done with a full group.  

## All the Things (ATT)
All the Things (ATT) is a popular addon to World of Warcraft that tracks everything in the game and allows players to find what they are missing. Some twitch streamers focus on increasing their ATT percentage. From a gold making perspective ATT allows players to find transmog they are missing and might look for it on the Auction House.

## Auction House (AH)
The auction house in World of Warcraft is where players can buy and sell items. Consumables are shared across all realms within a region, while non-consumables (e.g. non-stackable loot) are realm specific.

## Bind on Equip (BOE)
Bind on Equip (BOE) refers to items that can be sold or traded with other players and are not bound to the player until the item is used.

## Bind on Pickup (BOP)
Bind on Pickup (BOP) refers to items that are bound to the player immediately after being looted. They cannot be sold on the auction house.

## Hyperspawn
Certain mobs in World of Warcraft are tied to quest chains.  In order for the game to ensure players doing the quests have mobs to kill there is usually a minimum number of that creatures that needs to be alive in the game.  Hyperspawning is a tactic used by the gold making community to cause mobs to spawn very quickly by continuously killing as many as possible. This increases the amount of loot that everyone obtains because more mobs are being killed. An example of a hyperspawn farm is the [Silithus](/farms/openworld/silithus) farm.

## Loot
Loot has multiple meanings in the gold making community. The noun meaning is the items that are dropped by mobs. The verb to loot is the process of collecting 

## Loot Table
The loot table for a mob, dungeon, or zone refers to all possible items that can be dropped by that mob or in that dungeon or zone.  Some loot is very specifically tied to a singular mob, while other loot could be dropped by an mob in a dungeon or zone.

## Mob
A non-player character that is usually the target of being killed for a farm.  

## Non-player character (NPC)
A non-player character refers to any character in the game that is not controlled by a player.  This refers to mobs that are in the open world as well as characters that hand out quests or train you in professions in the capital city.

## Tag
Tagging is the act of doing damage to a mob to make yourself eligible to loot items from that mob.

## Transmog
World of Warcraft has a very powerful transmogrification system that allows you to change the appearance of your character based on items you have collected in the game.  For BOP items, they are learned when an item is picked up.  For BOE items, they are learned when the item is used by the player or sold to a vendor.  Recently Blizzard removed the requirement that the player has to be able to equip the item to add it to their collection, which makes farming up BOP items easier.
